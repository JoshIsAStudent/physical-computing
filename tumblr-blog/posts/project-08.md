# Final Project #8 : Assembly of the Machine

* Challenge - Attaching the servo motor (IMG_2482.MOV)

# Assembly
* Tried putting servo on metal wire - worked but wasn't in fixed position and cable was in the way
* Did current solution (cardbard on side with wire sticking out, then wrapped around servo to hold it in the air)

* Experimented with putting bit in position, spinning 360, then seeing if it was still hittable (often it wasn't)
* Also noticed motor had trouble spinning in a particular direction
* Even removing the disc - the issue remained
* After watching this video I thought of opening the motor up to see if something had gotten inside (fluff or blu tack) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15K9N1yVnhc
* However, once I realised I could just juggle the head up and down a few times, that's what I did, and it resolved the issue!
* Putting the disc back on, I was able to make it a tighter fit than before! (except it warbled, so I had to replace it anyway)
