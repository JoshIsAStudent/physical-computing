*Experiment conducted 2021/03/09*

# Components Used
This experiment uses the Arduino UNO R3 Project Starter Kit.
* 1 x UNO R3 Controller Board (the Arduino)
* 1 x Breadboard
* Breadboard jumper wires

# Step 1: Wiring the stepper motor
[]<[Info on how a stepper motor works included in my 4a notes]
[]<[Wired according to p.212 of the elegoo PDF. it didn't work]
[]<[Turns out, I had plugged the power supply onto the other side, meaning I had flipped it 180 deg and plugged the +/- to the inverse rows on the bread board]
