# Physical Computing with J
Howdy! 👋🏼

Welcome to the repository for Physical Computing with J!

**[Click here to visit the main blog.](https://physicalcomputingwithj.tumblr.com/)**

[post-content](/post-content) contains all of the code from each experiment I do. If you're curious, it also contains each blog post as it exists before I run it through my Python script that adds all the links and other content.

[tumblr-blog](/tumblr-blog) contains tools and files I use to create the Tumblr blog - including the aforementioned Python script.
