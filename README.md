# Physical Computing with J
Howdy! Welcome to the repository for Physical Computing with J.

**[Click here to visit the main blog.](https://physicalcomputingwithj.tumblr.com/)**

[post-content](/post-content) contains all of the code from each experiment I do. If you're curious, it also contains each blog post as it exists before I run it through my Python script that automatically adds some content for me.

[final-project](/final-project) contains the code I used in my final project. This is both the program that runs on the Arduino, as well as some other programs I wrote while testing and debuggin.

[tumblr-blog](/tumblr-blog) contains tools and files I use to create the Tumblr blog - including the aforementioned Python script.
