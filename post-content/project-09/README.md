# Final Project #9 : The Lean, Mean, Turing Machine!

Having assembled the full machine (and tampered with the memory to motor attachment a bit) I was able to get the machine fully operational! In the two videos below, the Turning Machine is running a program that increments the binary number in memory by one. Though, the Arduino program is capable of running any valid Turing Machine program is it given (in the format of a C data structure). The first video is a more polished demo - but unfortunately the machine wasn't able to count very far, so I also included the second video. It's not as good a demo, but in that video it counts up to four! (It's also a good demonstration of the failure-to-write failsafe.)
