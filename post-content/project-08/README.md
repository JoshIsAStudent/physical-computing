# Final Project #8 : Assembly of the Machine

The entire machine is build on a large cardboard box, which I did simply so I could easily move the machine as one unit. Each component is attached to the box by some combination of blu-tack, tape, carboard, and metal wire. Besides continual failure of the memory loop, there were only two other challenge I faced while physically putting the machine together.

## Attaching the Write Motor
The write motor needs to be suspended above the memory disc in such a way that the area around the disc is left clear for memory bits to pass through without hitting anything. Initially I suspended the motor in the air with a single piece of wire, as shown in the video below.

This worked reasonably well, and had the advantage that is was easy to adjust the position of the motor by bending the wire. However, because I had taped the wire to the side of box, it was able to rotate back and forth, meaning I couldn't move the cables connecting to the motor out of the way of the memory loop without also moving the motor.

Without a better way to keep the wire stable, my solution was to attach another piece of cardboard to the box and drive the wire through it at two different points. This allowed the wire to stay in a fixed position, while still being moved about.

## Protecting the Photoresistor
The challenges I faced with the memory disc had knock on effects on the read head. In testing, I had discovered that the photoresistor worked better if it was positioned as close as possible to where a flipped cardboard bit would land when blocking it. However, when the disc warbled, this would cause flipped bits to strike the photoresistor from the side. This in turn caused the stepper motor to get stuck, and the photoresistor to get bent out of place.

My solution to this was to place a stack of post-it notes next to the photoresistor that prevent the disc from leaning too low. Sometimes this will create enough friction on the disk to prevent the stepper motor from turning, which in turn causes the memory disc to go out of sync. Overall though, this solution solves more problems then it creates.
